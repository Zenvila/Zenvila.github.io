Everything is explained clearly with theory, purpose, file structure, and commands.\nWhat is GitHub Actions? # GitHub Actions is a platform to automate software workflows like testing, building, or deploying your code. It\u0026rsquo;s not a CI/CD tool itself, but it enables automation where CI/CD is one of the many workflows.\nCI/CD is a development practice. GitHub Actions is a platform to automate it.\nWhat are workflows? # Let’s understand it simply. Suppose you\u0026rsquo;re hosting a website on GitHub Pages. When you make changes on your local system and push them, you expect GitHub to reflect those changes.\nBut what if:\nYou made a mistake\nYou pushed code with an error\nThe deployment silently fails?\nGitHub Actions gives you an \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo; tab where you can see every deployment and whether your push was successful. That background process of validating, testing, and deploying is called a workflow.\nWhat is an Event? # An event is a trigger that causes a GitHub workflow to run.\nExamples:\nSomeone pushes code (git push)\nA pull request is opened\nA schedule is reached (cron jobs)\nWhat is CI/CD? # | Term | Meaning | | | | | CI (Continuous Integration) | Automatically test code after every push | | CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) | Automatically build and deploy the app if tests pass |\nCI/CD ensures software updates are automatic, reliable, and repeatable.\nGitHub Actions runs workflows inside a temporary Ubuntu machine (called a \u0026ldquo;runner\u0026rdquo;).\nAre GitHub Actions OS Dependent? # No. GitHub Actions is not system dependent. You can choose the operating system via:\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest # or windows-latest, macos-latest GitHub creates a virtual machine (VM) based on your config, installs dependencies, runs your code, and deletes the VM.\nYour code is tested according to the test cases you provide. This step is called CI. If successful, it proceeds to CD, which builds a container and deploys the app.\nLet’s Do It Practically (CI + CD) # Project Structure # ubuntu-ci-cd/ # Main directory ├── index.js # App logic ├── index.test.js # Test cases ├── package.json # Dependencies/scripts ├── Dockerfile # Docker build config (CD) └── .github/ # GitHub workflow directory └── workflows/ └── ci-cd.yml # Workflow definition File-by-File Breakdown # 1. index.js # Purpose:\nYour actual app code (e.g., a function, backend, etc.) function hello(name) { return `Hello, ${name}`; } module.exports = hello; Why: This is the code to test and deploy.\n2. index.test.js # Purpose:\nContains test cases for your app. const hello = require(\u0026#39;./index\u0026#39;); test(\u0026#39;says hello to Zen\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { expect(hello(\u0026#39;Zen\u0026#39;)).toBe(\u0026#39;Hello, Zen\u0026#39;); }); Why: This is used for CI. If tests fail, deployment is skipped.\n3. package.json # Purpose:\nNode.js config for scripts and dependencies { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ubuntu-ci-cd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;jest\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;devDependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;jest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^29.0.0\u0026#34; } } Why:\nDeclares dependencies\nTells GitHub how to run tests\n4. Dockerfile # Purpose:\nBuilds a Docker image (CD step) FROM node:18-slim WORKDIR /app COPY . . RUN npm install CMD [\u0026#34;npm\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;] Why:\nContainerizes your app\nMakes it deployable to DockerHub/Kubernetes, etc.\n5. .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml # Purpose:\nThe CI/CD automation script name: CI + CD on Ubuntu on: push: branches: [main] jobs: build-test-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Set up Node.js uses: actions/setup-node@v3 with: node-version: \u0026#39;18\u0026#39; - name: Install dependencies run: npm install - name: Run tests (CI) run: npm test - name: Build Docker image (CD) run: docker build -t ubuntu-test-app . - name: Run container (simulate deploy) run: docker run --rm ubuntu-test-app Local Testing # cd ubuntu-ci-cd # Run tests manually npm install npm test # Build Docker image docker build -t ubuntu-test-app . # Run container docker run --rm ubuntu-test-app Remote Testing with GitHub Actions # git init git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ubuntu-ci-cd.git git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git branch -M main git push -u origin main GitHub will trigger .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml automatically.\nGo to Actions tab in your GitHub repo to see logs and status.\nSummary Table # | File | Role | Purpose | | | | | | index.js | App code | Code you want to test/deploy | | index.test.js | Test file | Runs automatically to check code | | package.json | Config file | Declares dependencies \u0026amp; scripts | | Dockerfile | Build instructions | Builds Docker image with Ubuntu | | ci-cd.yml | Workflow | Automates test + build + deploy |\nGitHub Actions: Operating System Runners # | runs-on: | GitHub Runner VM | | | | | ubuntu-latest | Ubuntu 22.04 | | windows-latest | Windows Server | | macos-latest | macOS Big Sur/Catalina |\nWhy CI Might Fail in GitHub Actions # Bug in your code\nWrong or missing dependencies\nJest test failed\nThis has nothing to do with Arch or Ubuntu. It’s logic-related. Now you know:\nWhat GitHub Actions is\nWhat CI/CD means\nHow workflows trigger\nHow to build and test an app locally and remotely\nYou\u0026rsquo;re ready to automate!\nP.S. # If you spot any mistakes, feel free to point them out — we’re all here to learn together! 😊\nHaris\nFAST-NUCES\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\n🔗 Portfolio: zenvila.github.io\n🔗 GitHub: github.com/Zenvila\n🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad-7b8746291\n🔬 Member: COLAB (Research Lab)\n","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cicd-github-actions/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Cicd Github Actions","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/containers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Containers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Home","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/technology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/data-science/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Data Science","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/testing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Testing","type":"tags"},{"content":" Unit Testing in Python # A Must-Know for Every Programmer # Unit testing is one of the most crucial topics that every programmer should be familiar with.

Two significant components in modern cryptographic systems are OpenSSL and RSA, both widely used for securing data transmissions, especially over the internet.\nOpenSSL # OpenSSL is an open-source software library that provides tools for implementing secure communications. It supports various cryptographic functions and is essential in many secure web protocols, such as HTTPS. Here are some key features of OpenSSL:\nCryptographic Algorithms Support: OpenSSL supports a wide range of encryption algorithms, including AES, RSA, and SHA, making it versatile for different encryption needs.\nSSL and TLS Protocols: It provides robust support for SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols, which are crucial for establishing secure connections over networks.\nCertificate Management: OpenSSL facilitates the generation, signing, and management of SSL certificates, which authenticate websites and encrypt communication between a client and a server.\nCommand-Line Utility: It offers powerful command-line tools for encryption, decryption, and certificate management, which makes it easy to use for both testing and practical deployment.\nOpen-Source and Extensible: Being open-source, OpenSSL is widely accessible and continually improved upon by the community, making it highly adaptable to emerging security standards.\nRSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) # RSA is one of the earliest and most widely used public-key encryption algorithms. It operates on the principles of asymmetric encryption, which uses two keys—a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Key features of RSA include:\nAsymmetric Encryption: RSA\u0026rsquo;s core concept is based on public and private key pairs, enhancing security as only the private key can decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key.\nMathematical Foundation: RSA relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, which makes the encryption process highly secure against unauthorized decryption.\nKey Length and Security: RSA typically uses key lengths of 2048 bits or more, ensuring a high level of security. Longer key lengths make it exponentially more challenging for attackers to compromise the encryption.\nDigital Signatures: RSA is commonly used to generate digital signatures, allowing for verification of the authenticity and integrity of data, a critical feature in secure communications.\nWidely Supported: Due to its long-standing reputation and robustness, RSA is supported across various platforms and protocols, making it compatible with numerous applications in secure data transmission. By combining the strengths of OpenSSL and RSA, cryptographic systems can ensure secure, authenticated, and private communication in many digital environments.\nAll the practical aspects are available in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/ZenTeknik/COLAB.git.

To make it simple, think about story-based games. Have you ever noticed how games let us save our progress and later load the game from the same spot? That’s just like what CRIU does, but for real processes running on Linux.\nGames don’t use CRIU though — they use more advanced systems like Steam Cloud. The game example is just to help you understand the basic idea.\nSo, what is CRIU? # CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace) allows us to create a checkpoint of a running process and save it to the disk. Later, we can restore the same process from that saved point — even on another system.\nCRIU is a utility mainly used on Linux systems. It works in the user space, which means it\u0026rsquo;s not part of the kernel, and that makes it more flexible.\nBeyond Games – How It Works Technically # It’s not just for games. CRIU is powerful in operating systems for:\nProcess migration (move a process to another system)\nLive updates (update without stopping the app)\nRunning the same process on another machine even after reboot\nWhat is CRIU? # CRIU is a powerful tool that lets you freeze a running process and later restore it from disk. You can save its memory, open files, and more. You can even bring it back to life on another machine.\nCRIU = Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace # CRIU allows saving and restoring apps or containers to/from disk images.\nBreakdown of Features # Checkpoint/Restore: Take a snapshot of an app’s current state and restore it later.\nIn Userspace: Not part of the kernel, more adaptable to different Linux versions.\nKey Capabilities:\n🛰️ Live Migration\n📸 Snapshots\n🧪 Remote Debugging\n🐳 Works with Docker \u0026amp; Podman\nHow Does CRIU Work? # CRIU can manage multi-threaded apps, open network sockets, and even containers. But it needs root access (using sudo, SUID bit, or Linux capabilities).\nWhy Was CRIU Developed? # Let’s look at the real-world problems it solves:\n| Problem | Explanation | | | | | ✅ Long-running apps | Don’t restart apps every time you update or reboot. | | ✅ Process Migration | Move apps between machines. | | ✅ Live Upgrades | Update the system without shutting apps. | | ✅ Fault Recovery | Crash? Restore from last checkpoint. | | ✅ Cloud Scaling | Move Docker containers between data centers. |\nWhat Does CRIU Save? # When creating a checkpoint, CRIU saves:\n🧠 Memory (RAM)\n📂 Open files and file descriptors\n🌐 Network connections\n🌲 Process tree\n🧵 Threads and signals\n🧬 Kernel namespaces\n⚠️ Limitation: It doesn’t support VRAM-heavy apps like games using CUDA/OpenCL.\nWhere is CUDA Used? # CUDA is an NVIDIA software platform. Since it heavily relies on VRAM, CRIU isn\u0026rsquo;t suitable for GPU-heavy tasks.\nCRIU is best for CPU-based processes and Docker containers.\nBenefits of CRIU # ⏸️ Pause/resume long-running apps\n🚀 Faster start (from saved state)\n🧳 Migrate running apps\n🐳 Supports Docker \u0026amp; containers\n🔁 Less downtime during updates\n🛠️ Debug or recover apps\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Try It – A Simple CRIU Implementation # 1. Install CRIU on Arch Linux # sudo pacman -S criu ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749669219351/a8ec3448-e867-487e-90a7-715953c14bc2.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nIf you get a \u0026ldquo;target not found\u0026rdquo; error, enable the [community] or [extra] repo.\n2. Verify Installation # criu check ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749720320836/677b9231-c32c-4278-99d7-74452429cdb7.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\n3. Create a Test Process # sleep 1000 \u0026amp; ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749720406087/47dff455-1c53-443d-9971-24b011b34c57.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nGet the PID using:\nps aux | grep sleep ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749720431085/6850cd88-5dfd-4b3a-b356-aa831de0efee.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\n4. Checkpoint the Process # mkdir ~/criu-dump Then:\nsudo criu dump -t \u0026lt;PID\u0026gt; -D ~/criu-dump --shell-job --leave-running What these options mean: # -t \u0026lt;PID\u0026gt; → Process ID to checkpoint\n-D ~/criu-dump → Directory to save checkpoint files\n--shell-job → Needed if it\u0026rsquo;s a shell-launched process\n--leave-running → Keep the original process running\n5. Kill the Process # Simulate a crash:\nkill \u0026lt;PID\u0026gt; 6. Restore from Checkpoint\nsudo criu restore -D ~/criu-dump --shell-job 7. Check the Saved Files # cd ~/criu-dump ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749720468618/81b2a20d-0ec6-4bcf-990a-504e3b336e71.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nYou’ll see:\nimages/ → Memory, open files, etc.\nstats-dump → Process stats\ndump.log → Log file (useful if it failed)\nIn the attached picture above, you can see some images representing the process states that we dumped into the directory. These images include everything related to the process, such as memory, file descriptors, and more. If we want to restore the process, we can do so using these images. Moreover, if we want to restore the process on another system, we can simply move these images to that system. This allows us to open the process in the same state, with the same memory and configuration it had when it was saved.\nConclusion : # CRIU is not just a cool Linux tool — it’s a real-world solution for system admins, container managers, cloud engineers, and even developers. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re live migrating services or debugging frozen apps, CRIU gives you full control over running processes.\nP.S.\nIf you spot any mistakes, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to point them out.

It can include rule-based logic.\nWhat is Machine Learning? # ML is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.\nGoal: Make predictions or decisions based on data by training algorithms.\nIt learns patterns from data, is always data-driven, and is more focused and technical.\nHow is it different from Data Mining? # Actually, data mining is when we extract some meaning from the data.\nWhen we extract data, we then give it to a human, and the human is responsible for whatever informed decisions are made.\nMachine learning is used as a small part — a tool — in this process.\nBut usually in machine learning, we are not making or extracting meaning for a person, but we are extracting meaning that the machine can understand. The machine extracts the meaning from the data and also tries to understand it in order to do some extra work on the same data.\nExample: How a Machine Extracts Meaning from an Image # Let’s try to understand how a machine extracts meaning from a static image.\nIt’s just pixels, and pixels just have colors (red, blue, green). But the machine finds some sort of combination and then tells us what it actually is.\nWhat Tools Are Used for Machine Learning? # Torch # It is an open-source tool which is built on Lua. It is a Python-like language. It is very powerful.\nTorch is extremely scalable. You can run it on a cluster or multiple GPUs. It is easily scalable with just a change of a couple of lines of code.\nIf you write code for GPU and want to use the same code for CPU, you only need to change a few lines of code — not more than that — and it will be successful.\nModern GPUs today use the Torch library. We can write GPU-accelerated code using the Torch library.\nTheano # Theano is basically an alternative model based on Python. It is symbolic computation.\nTheano is a Python library (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) that was made for:\nDeep learning using symbolic computation\nFirst building a \u0026ldquo;math graph\u0026rdquo; of your model\nThen optimizing and running it efficiently on CPU and GPU\nIn Theano, when you define a model or calculation:\nYou’re not doing it immediately\nYou’re just describing the steps (like writing a math formula)\nThen later, Theano:\nBuilds a graph of your operations (symbolic)\nOptimizes it\nRuns it efficiently on CPU or GPU Note: First understand — Torch is dynamic, which means as we write the code, it runs the same way.\nOn the other hand, Theano is symbolic, meaning it builds computations first, then runs them.\nBut Theano is hard to debug and learn, and it is replaced by TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. Now, let’s discuss this further:\nTheano is replaced by JAX (it is symbolic graph-based but more optimized than Theano)\nTensorFlow is both symbolic and dynamic\nTensorFlow 1.x is static graph\nTensorFlow 2.x is dynamic by default\nDynamic execution makes coding and debugging easier.\nStill, Python is slow for such tasks, so what does symbolic execution actually do?\nIt creates a backend C code, and then it runs that C code — which makes Python code faster. It does all the backend computation internally.\nKeras # Keras is a high-level deep learning library in Python that lets you build and train neural networks easily.\nYou don’t need to write complicated code — just a few lines to define layers, and Keras handles the rest.\nWhen you write code in Keras today, it’s really using TensorFlow under the hood.\nScikit-learn # Scikit-learn (or sklearn) is a Python library used for machine learning, especially traditional ML — like decision trees, SVMs, clustering, and regression. It is very well documented.\nScikit-learn is the go-to tool for classical machine learning — it’s fast, simple, and great for real-world datasets like CSV files, customer data, etc.\nWhere we need traditional ML (no GPU support), and for data types like CSV, tables, NumPy — Scikit-learn is very easy to use.\nOn the other hand, PyTorch and TensorFlow are for deep learning — where we need GPU support and work with tensor data types. These are more complex.\nMahout (Hadoop) # Apache Mahout is a machine learning library built to run on big data systems like Hadoop.\nMahout lets you run ML algorithms on huge datasets that can’t fit on a normal computer — using Hadoop\u0026rsquo;s distributed power. Example:\nImagine you have data from 10 million customers.\nWith Mahout + Hadoop:\nIt splits the work across many machines\nAll machines work together\nYou get results fast, even for huge data\n| Component | Purpose | | | | | Hadoop | Handles big data \u0026amp; distributes it | | Mahout | Runs ML algorithms on that data | How does it run on many machines?\nSuppose we have very big data — say, 5000 GB. If we want to do classification or apply some ML task on that data, it will take too much time.\nWhat Mahout does:\nBreaks the data into chunks (e.g., 1000 GB each)\nRuns it on 5 different servers\nEach server processes its chunk using ML algorithms\nResults are collected and merged from all machines\nWe get the final output fast — even for big data.\nCaffe # Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) is a deep learning framework made by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC), focused mainly on image-related tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation.\nIt is used for:\nImage classification\nObject detection\nRunning fast pre-trained CNNs\nEmbedded systems (older edge AI projects)\nCaffe is a deep learning framework made for fast image processing, especially CNNs. It’s fast and good for deployment, but less flexible — that’s why today most people use PyTorch or TensorFlow instead.\nFinal Note # A library gives you tools — you decide how to use them.\nA framework gives you structure — it tells you how to build.\nP.S.\nIf you spot any mistakes, feel free to point them out — we’re all here to learn together! 😊\nHaris\nFAST-NUCES\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\n🔗 Portfolio: zenvila.github.io\n🔗 GitHub: github.com/Zenvila\n🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad-7b8746291**\n🔬 Member: COLAB (Research Lab)**\n","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/machine-learning-and-its-tools/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Machine Learning And Its Tools","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/programming/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Programming","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/data-analysis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Data Analysis","type":"tags"},{"content":" The Challenge # Real estate investment decisions lack data-driven insights.

Imagine pressing a button on an ATM and the whole machine freezing until cash dispenses. Or asking ChatGPT something, and it makes you wait in a queue behind 100 people.\nThis is where Asynchronous (async) programming comes in. Async isn’t just a coding trick; it’s a principle of software efficiency, comparable to control theory in engineering.\nSynchronous (Sync): Tasks run one after another, each must finish before the next starts.\nAsynchronous (Async): Tasks can overlap in time, allowing the CPU to handle other work while waiting.\nWhat is Async Programming? # In traditional (synchronous) code:\nTasks run one after another.\nIf one task waits (e.g., network call, disk read), the whole program waits.\nIn async programming:\nTasks don’t block each other.\nWhile one task waits, the CPU does other work.\nResult → smooth multitasking without needing multiple CPUs/threads.\nAsync and Control Theory # Control theory ensures systems remain stable by reacting quickly to changes. Delayed feedback can make a physical system unstable.\nAsync plays the same role in computing:\nWithout async → software stalls, delays cascade, users lose responsiveness.\nWith async → systems remain stable, responsive, and efficient.\nExample:\nA robot running sync code → can’t read sensors until motor stops. Unstable.\nA robot with async → reads sensors + moves simultaneously. Stable.\nAsync in LLM Applications (AI) # One of the best examples today is Large Language Models (LLMs):\nSync LLM requests: Each user request waits until the previous one is fully served.\n→ Slow, costly, unscalable.\nAsync LLM requests: While one request waits on GPU, others are scheduled.\n→ Many users served at once.\nOther AI benefits:\nStreaming outputs → get words as they’re generated.\nParallel pipelines in RAG → data fetching, embedding, and querying overlap.\nCost efficiency → GPUs never sit idle.\nWithout async, tools like ChatGPT would feel like waiting in a long bank queue.\nAsync in Broader Computer Science # Async bridges software and hardware:\nHardware (OS level) → event loops (epoll, IOCP) notify when I/O is ready.\nSoftware (language level) → async/await in Python, JS, Rust, Go.\nApplications:\nWeb servers (FastAPI, Node.js).\nRobotics (ROS2 event-driven sensors).\nSecurity (fuzzing multiple endpoints in parallel).\nAI (non-blocking training/inference pipelines).\nIt’s a unifying technique across operating systems, software frameworks, and applications.\nDemo: Async in Action # import asyncio import time # Simulate an LLM request (each takes 3 seconds) def sync_llm_request(name): time.sleep(3) print(f\u0026#34;{name} response ready\u0026#34;) async def async_llm_request(name): await asyncio.sleep(3) print(f\u0026#34;{name} response ready\u0026#34;) # Synchronous version def sync_main(): start = time.time() for i in range(1, 4): sync_llm_request(f\u0026#34;Request {i}\u0026#34;) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#34;Synchronous total time: {end - start:.2f} seconds\u0026#34;) # Asynchronous version async def async_main(): start = time.time() tasks = [async_llm_request(f\u0026#34;Request {i}\u0026#34;) for i in range(1, 4)] await asyncio.gather(*tasks) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#34;Asynchronous total time: {end - start:.2f} seconds\u0026#34;) # Run demo print(\u0026#34;\\n Sync Execution \u0026#34;) sync_main() print(\u0026#34;\\n Async Execution \u0026#34;) asyncio.run(async_main()) Result:\nSync → 9 seconds.\nAsync → 3 seconds.\nJust like in real AI servers → async cuts waiting time dramatically.\nConclusion # Async programming isn’t just about speed. It’s about:\nResponsiveness: Systems feel alive.\nEfficiency: Hardware is fully utilized.\nScalability: Serve more users without more CPUs.\nJust as control theory keeps machines stable, async keeps digital systems efficient and responsive. From robots to LLMs, async is the silent engine of modern computing.\nAsync is not faster computing—it’s smarter computing.\nHaris\nFAST-NUCES\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\n🔗 Portfolio: zenvila.github.io\n🔗 GitHub: github.com/Zenvila\n🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad-7b8746291**\n🔬 Member: COLAB (Research Lab)**\n","date":"8 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-hidden-control-loop-of-modern-software/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Hidden Control Loop Of Modern Software","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/computer-vision/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Computer Vision","type":"tags"},{"content":" The Challenge # Large language models require internet connectivity and expensive cloud APIs.

Monitoring tools automate this process by checking the system\u0026rsquo;s status at regular intervals.\nThis guide explains how to monitor an Apache web server using the Monit framework on Arch Linux.\nInstalling Monit and Apache Web Server # Note: The following commands are based on Arch Linux. You may need to adapt them for your own Linux distribution.\nInstall the Apache web server:\nsudo pacman -S apache Install Monit:\nsudo pacman -S monit Configuring Monit # Open the Monit configuration file:\nsudo nano /etc/monit/monitrc Configure the file according to your requirements. For example, you can set up Monit to monitor the Apache service. Ensure you include settings such as the port (default: 2812) and authentication if required.\nCheck the syntax of the configuration file:\nsudo monit -t Starting and Enabling Monit # Enable the Monit service to start at boot:\nsudo systemctl enable monit Start the Monit service:\nsudo systemctl start monit If you make changes to the configuration, restart Monit:\nsudo systemctl restart monit Configuring Apache Web Server # Ensure Apache is installed:\nsudo pacman -S apache Enable Apache to start at boot:\nsudo systemctl enable httpd Start the Apache service:\nsudo systemctl start httpd Verifying Monit Service # Open the Monit defaults file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/monit Ensure Monit is configured to monitor the desired services.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNf1_issZRrxlQNTC6IYvDoFHeTdZk9Xp1mYoKLMhfxkTzfYZmSvF-irFFzxwfnyZ-CnF03Em9iRArr8m_ZUroqBmWKLZwVZNrvvxl6FLojdVAxkvhliSU52_kXFkMnDiLXq_AYggpZspDqB6Dg1claDiZkR4pgSGG8Gld7zdAgD6qSBcilss8LnO2UJQ/w590-h57/Screenshot_20250114_071924.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nInstall a text-based web browser to access Monit from the terminal:\nsudo pacman -S links Checking Port Status # To ensure Monit is listening on the configured port, use the following command:\nnetstat -nutlp Use links to check the Monit web interface on port 2812 (or the port you configured):\nlinks http://localhost:2812 Conclusion of Monit # Monit is a lightweight and efficient tool for automating system monitoring and ensuring reliability. It simplifies the management of services like Apache, detects issues proactively, and reduces manual intervention. By using Monit, system administrators can achieve high uptime and focus on other critical tasks, making it an essential tool for maintaining system health. P.S.

Introduction: Embarking on the journey of learning Git and GitHub can be a challenging but essential step for any aspiring developer. In this blog, we\u0026rsquo;ll break down the fundamental concepts and provide a step-by-step guide to help you navigate through the process of pushing and pulling code.\nUnderstanding the Basics:\nGit: Git is a powerful version control system designed to track changes in your codebase. Its key features include:\nTracking the history of changes.\nFacilitating collaboration among developers.\nGitHub: GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that leverages Git for code management. It allows developers to store, collaborate, and manage their code repositories. Think of GitHub as a user-friendly interface built on top of Git.\nSetting Up Your Environment:\nInstall Git: Depending on your operating system (Windows or Linux), install Git to your local machine.\nDownload Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A widely used code editor that integrates seamlessly with Git.\nOpen VS Code Terminal: Access the terminal within VS Code to execute Git commands.\nConfiguring Git:\ngit --version git config --global user.name \u0026#34;your GitHub account name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;your GitHub email account\u0026#34; Working with Repositories:\nClone a Repository:\nCopy the repository URL from GitHub.\nIn the terminal, execute: git clone [repository_url].\nMaking Changes:\nOpen the cloned repository in VS Code.\nWrite or modify your code.\nCommitting Changes:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Write your simple message here\u0026#34; git push origin main Pulling Changes:\ngit pull origin main Creating a New Repository:\ngit init git checkout -b [branch_name] # Create a new branch git branch -d [branch_name] # Delete a branch Conclusion: Mastering Git and GitHub is crucial for efficient collaboration and version control in software development. By following these steps and commands, you can confidently navigate the basics of Git and GitHub. Apologies for any errors, and feel free to explore further to enhance your understanding.

If you’re into embedded AI, robotics, or system development, you’ll often need an ARM environment for testing and optimization.\nBut here’s the challenge: what if you don’t own a Raspberry Pi or ARM board? What if you want to simulate and test ARM-specific tools and software directly on your x86 PC?\nThat’s exactly what we’ll do here: build a fully working ARM64 (aarch64) Debian environment inside an x86 PC running Arch Linux. It feels almost magical—you’re essentially pretending your PC is a Raspberry Pi.\nThis is especially powerful for embedded AI development, where optimization meets intelligence. You can test how your AI models behave in constrained ARM environments before deploying them to real hardware.\nSetting Up the ARM Lab on Arch Linux # We’ll use QEMU (Quick Emulator) with binfmt_misc support to run ARM binaries transparently on an x86 host.\nStep 1. Install the required packages # sudo pacman -S qemu-user-static debootstrap These packages give you the ability to emulate ARM instructions and bootstrap a Debian ARM root filesystem.\nStep 2. Verify binfmt support # Start systemd-binfmt (it manages interpreters for foreign architectures):\nsudo systemctl start systemd-binfmt Check registered emulators:\nls /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/ You should see entries like qemu-aarch64 and qemu-arm, meaning your system is ready to run ARM binaries.\nStep 3. Create a working directory # mkdir ~/arm-lab cd ~/arm-lab This is where your ARM environment will live.\nStep 4. Bootstrap an ARM Debian root filesystem # Use debootstrap to install a minimal Debian system for ARM64 inside your directory:\nsudo debootstrap --arch=arm64 bookworm debian-arm64 http://deb.debian.org/debian This downloads and extracts a fresh Debian ARM rootfs into debian-arm64.\nStep 5. Enter the ARM environment # Now, use chroot to enter it:\nsudo chroot debian-arm64 /bin/bash Congratulations! You’re inside a Debian ARM64 environment, running on your x86 PC.\nPretend Your PC is a Raspberry Pi # Inside your ARM Debian shell, install neofetch:\napt update apt install neofetch -y neofetch It will proudly report aarch64 architecture—just like a real Raspberry Pi.\nEven better, you can now install ARM64-only packages that won’t work on x86.\nTrick your friends:\n“I’ve got a Raspberry Pi running… inside my Arch PC!”\nWhy This Matters for Embedded AI # When working on robotics, drones, or aerospace software, you often cannot run heavy x86 code. You need:\nCross-compilation skills (build on x86, deploy on ARM).\nTesting environments (validate on ARM before touching hardware).\nOptimization awareness (SIMD instructions, low memory usage).\nBy setting up this ARM lab, you gain practical knowledge that bridges system programming and embedded AI.\nYou don’t just learn theory—you actually see how software behaves differently on ARM. This is exactly the mindset required to build intelligent systems where optimization meets intelligence.\nFinal Thoughts # With just a few commands, you’ve unlocked the ability to simulate Raspberry Pi on your PC:\nNo hardware required.\nFull ARM environment.\nAbility to install ARM64-only packages.\nPerfect playground for embedded AI.\nSo next time you hear someone say, “I wish I had a Raspberry Pi for testing”, you’ll know the answer:\nYou can run it directly on your PC.\nHaris\nFAST-NUCES\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\n🔗 Portfolio: zenvila.github.io\n🔗 GitHub: github.com/Zenvila\n🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad-7b8746291\n🔬 Member: COLAB (Research Lab)\n","date":"24 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/running-arm-raspberry-pi-on-your-pc-without-hardware/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Running Arm Raspberry Pi On Your Pc Without Hardware","type":"posts"},{"content":" The Building Blocks of Modern Computing # What is a Thread? # Before diving into the concept of threads, let’s consider a common example. Imagine a company named X with four employees. Each employee is assigned their own task, and they upload their completed work to a shared database. These tasks might range from creating an entire application to completing a small part of it. At the end of the day, all their contributions combine to form the final application. In this analogy, each employee represents a thread, while the company represents the process.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZEylfCI_oZbyb5d0fQzQVbQSxy6ILbktlqRJsPfOH1CNVvy6Y2MjLNwSP4qeOhH0ul3ThOYR7g_yrHsC06Kf6Nrzkf8YUMwEUE_8m4XhULTXZGL8Q8XH6ZPAcHhBBf932ikaxQiC-sAEKtJHfyccRHGdPG1h8Y87WgQ7Hkw_1QFEjkIjXod6TC_U-VlDc/w431-h243/Thread%20exp.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nKey Terms in Threading # Single-threaded Process:\nIn a single-threaded process, one thread executes the entire sequence of operations sequentially.\nMulti-threaded Process:\nIn a multi-threaded process, multiple threads work together, with each thread handling a specific part of the sequence of operations. The combined effort of these threads results in the completion of the task.\nShared Resources in Threads # All threads within the same process share certain resources, such as code or heap memory. This concept is referred to as shared resources.\nProgram vs. Process # Program: A program is a set of instructions written to perform a task.\nProcess: A process is the actual execution of a program. Multiple processes can be associated with the same program.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcZ36rJJHjMCClndN6pw5WNQU15kK4EjAVvGLnIxeAay9eIScsBHwHTlUFlHOHEOheFSBE6x4Pz-YQ6BfNp2-UqPfsOqgr6v7zhKko9ppgO07bdqQ8MXHi6qYtATGXZY76zHLbeyMgj7wD8TIoiwv28Jsmwbhfofez84h3IBNJMII2LKstlEsAXIeLrEBc/w362-h299/Screenshot_20250105_171435.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nUnderstanding Parallelism # You may have heard terms like quad-core or octa-core processors. These terms indicate the number of threads a processor can handle simultaneously:\nA quad-core processor can run four threads in parallel.\nAn octa-core processor can run eight threads in parallel.\nAlthough it seems like multiple threads are running at the same time, in reality, the processor activates only a few threads at any given moment. This creates the illusion of parallel execution.\nParallel vs. Concurrent Threads # Parallel Threads: These threads run simultaneously on separate CPU cores.\nConcurrent Threads: These threads share resources, such as memory or files. When one thread needs a shared resource that another thread is using, it must wait for the resource to become available. This waiting is referred to as concurrency.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj60LlEF7yWplA5y8FzM1WtW5lrsU1z6IqVAuzPtnvuz7kUmcTJCUhjv7tp-7ECM7T8q0HBZQAVMyjmRt_YGu2dm-vPXKvu22gN7Q4G5NY8wIJpsuTw0zTIXZ1unbNM_ogagO1lwVykl-MVs0F6CI9Z5J-Dq8qTE7BGSgQPgzR400jO4YOVJRUR1UvwjFa7/w361-h374/Screenshot_20250105_171621.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nRole of the Scheduler # To minimize the waiting time in concurrent threads, the operating system scheduler ensures efficient distribution of processing time among threads.

This includes downloading the ISO image, partitioning storage, automating user creation, monitoring the system, and ensuring proper user authorization.\nStep 1: Downloading Ubuntu Server # To begin, download the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Ubuntu Server from the official website:\n🔗 Download Ubuntu Server \\[**[https://ubuntu.com/download/server#manual-install](https://ubuntu.com/download/server#manual-install)**\\]\nAfter downloading, create a bootable USB using Rufus (for Windows) or the dd command (for Linux/macOS). Once the bootable media is ready, proceed with the installation on your server machine.\nStep 2: Storage and Partitioning # During installation, you may need to configure storage and partitioning:\nUsing a Single Disk? The default partitioning should be sufficient.\nAdding an Extra Disk? You need to manually configure mounting.\n📌 Optional: Mounting an Extra Disk\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re adding an extra disk, follow these steps:\nIdentify available disks:\nlsblk Create a new partition and format it as ext4:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb Mount the disk to a directory (e.g., /mnt/storage):\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/storage sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/storage To make the mount persistent, add this entry to /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sdb /mnt/storage ext4 defaults 0 2 If you\u0026rsquo;re not using an extra disk, this step can be skipped.\nStep 3: User Creation and Automation # After storage configuration, the next step is to create **multiple users automatically** using an automation script. Instead of manually adding users, we will use a **pre-configured script** to streamline the process. 👉 [**Automation Script for User Creation**](https://github.com/Zenvila/ubuntu-cloud) **\\[**[https://github.com/Zenvila/ubuntu-cloud](https://github.com/Zenvila/ubuntu-cloud)**\\]** ### sudo pacman -S monit**What this script does:** ✔ Creates multiple users with predefined settings. ✔ Assigns appropriate permissions. ✔ Sets up SSH access for secure remote login. Run the script and ensure all users are correctly created. Step 4: Server Monitoring with Monit # Now that the cloud setup is complete, **system monitoring** is crucial to ensure stability and prevent resource overuse. We will use **Monit** for real-time performance tracking and automated alerts. 🔗 [**Complete Guide to Monit**](https://systemadmin-insights.hashnode.dev/system-monitoring) **\\[**[https://systemadmin-insights.hashnode.dev/system-monitoring](https://systemadmin-insights.hashnode.dev/system-monitoring)**\\]** ### **Why Monit?** ✔ Tracks CPU, RAM, and disk usage in real time. ✔ Sends email alerts if resource usage exceeds limits. ✔ Monitors processes and automatically restarts failed services. 📌 **Monit on Ubuntu Server vs Arch Linux** * If you are using **Arch Linux**, install Monit with `pacman`: ```bash sudo pacman -S monit ``` If you are using **Ubuntu Server**, install Monit with `apt`: ```bash sudo apt install monit ``` ## **Step 5: Security \u0026amp; User Authorization** To ensure a **secure cloud environment**, we have implemented **strict user authorization** and access control: ✅ Each user **cannot** access another user's data. ✅ **Admins** have separate privileges for system management. ✅ Proper group permissions are enforced to restrict unauthorized access. With **Monit configured**, if **CPU usage exceeds a specific threshold**, an **email alert** will be sent to the administrator’s mobile for immediate action. Conclusion # In this guide, we have: ✅ Installed Ubuntu Server and configured storage. ✅ Set up automated user creation for efficiency. ✅ Implemented Monit for real-time monitoring and alerts. ✅ Enforced security through user access control. With these steps, your **Ubuntu Server cloud** is now **fully optimized** for performance and security. 🚀 P.S. # If you spot any mistakes, please don't hesitate to point them out.

Text Preprocessing # Before a computer can understand text, it must be cleaned.\nThat includes:\nTokenization: Breaking text into smaller parts (words, phrases, or sentences).\n→ \u0026quot;Drone launched at Sector A\u0026quot; → [\u0026quot;Drone\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;launched\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;at\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Sector\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;]\nLowercasing: Convert all words to lowercase.\nRemoving Stopwords: Words like “the”, “is”, “at” which don’t add much meaning.\nLemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.\n→ “Flying”, “flies” → “fly”\n2. Feature Extraction # Once text is clean, we must turn it into numbers (vectors).\nCommon methods:\nBag of Words (BoW): Counts how many times each word appears.\nTF-IDF: Gives more importance to rare, informative words.\nWord Embeddings (like Word2Vec, GloVe): Represent words as dense vectors showing meaning and relationships.\n→ e.g., vector(\u0026quot;king\u0026quot;) - vector(\u0026quot;man\u0026quot;) + vector(\u0026quot;woman\u0026quot;) ≈ vector(\u0026quot;queen\u0026quot;)\n3. Sentence Embeddings # Words alone aren’t enough.\nSometimes, we need to represent entire sentences or paragraphs as single vectors.\nThat’s where Sentence Transformers come in.\nExample model:\nall-MiniLM-L6-v2 (used in your project).\nIt creates 384-dimensional embeddings for sentences that capture context and meaning.\nWhat Are Embeddings? # Think of embeddings as compressed meanings of words or sentences.\nEach word or sentence becomes a long list of numbers that describe its meaning.\nFor example:\n“Attack initiated at base.” → [0.23, -0.11, 0.09, ...]\n“Strike started near base.” → [0.21, -0.10, 0.08, ...]\nThese two vectors are close to each other — meaning the model “understands” they’re similar.\nYour Project: DroneLogNLP # Now let’s connect all that to what you built.\nYou made a system that can analyze drone operation logs using NLP and answer questions intelligently.\nStep-by-step Breakdown # 1. Synthetic Drone Logs # You had a dataset — synthetic_drone_logs.csv\nExample entries:\nTimestamp, Summary 2025-10-01 08:00, Drone launched from base Alpha. 2025-10-01 08:05, Drone detected unusual heat signatures in Sector B2. 2025-10-01 08:10, Strike executed on target in Sector B2. 2. Text Embedding # You used SentenceTransformer to convert each summary into a vector.\nThis created a numerical map of meanings for every log entry.\nFile: embedding_model.py\nResult:\nsummary_embeddings.npy — stores all embeddings.\n3. Query System # You allowed users to type natural queries like:\n“Show me the strike details in Sector B2.”\nThe system:\nConverts the query to an embedding.\nFinds which drone log embedding is closest in meaning.\nReturns that log as the best answer.\nThis is semantic search, not keyword search.\nIt understands meaning, not just words.\n4. GUI Interface # You built a Tkinter-based GUI — gui_tkinter.py\nSo instead of typing in the terminal, users get:\nA graphical window\nInput box for queries\nResult area for matched log\nBackground image for interface enhancement\nThis makes it user-friendly, especially for defense or control operators.\nReal-World Motivation # In defense systems or drone missions, huge log files are generated every hour.\nOperators have to manually scroll through logs to find critical details.\nFor example:\n“When was the drone launched?”\n“Which sector had a strike?”\n“What anomalies were detected?”\nYour project automates this process:\nAsk naturally, get instant results.\nIt saves time, improves accuracy, and assists in mission intelligence.\nTools \u0026amp; Technologies Used # | Tool | Purpose | | | | | Python | Core programming | | Sentence Transformers | Generate embeddings | | NumPy | Vector math and similarity calculation | | Tkinter | GUI development | | Pandas | Data handling and CSV processing | | Cosine Similarity | Measure semantic closeness | | Matplotlib (optional) | Visualization support |\nSkills You Demonstrated # Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nSemantic Search\nMachine Learning Fundamentals\nPython Development\nGUI Programming\nProblem-Solving for Defense Systems\nEnd-to-End Project Workflow\nUse Cases Beyond Defense # Cybersecurity Logs Analysis\nServer Logs Monitoring\nIncident Report Systems\nAutonomous Vehicle Event Tracking\nIndustrial Fault Diagnosis\nBasically — anywhere logs are produced and humans need quick insight.\nFinal Thoughts # “AI doesn’t just make machines smarter — it makes human decisions faster and more informed.”\nYour project, DroneLogNLP, shows how simple NLP ideas like embeddings and semantic search can turn raw data into something that responds intelligently.\nIt’s not just a student project — it’s a prototype for future command-and-control intelligence systems.\n","date":"1 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/understanding-nlp-from-basics-to-dronelognlp/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Understanding Nlp From Basics To Dronelognlp","type":"posts"},{"content":" Step-by-Step Arch Linux Installation \u0026amp; Post-Setup # Complete Arch Linux Installation and Configuration Guide # Introduction # This guide provides a step-by-step process for installing Arch Linux and setting up essential configurations, including networking, user management, and software installation.

Among them, Docker has emerged as a cornerstone technology, bridging software and hardware seamlessly. In this blog, we’ll explore Docker’s journey, how it’s evolving in the AI era, and how I experimented with it in a mini-project.\nWhat is Docker? # Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications along with all their dependencies into a container. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that ensure the app runs consistently across different machines. Think of it as a “portable app box” that contains everything your program needs: code, libraries, and system tools.\nWhy it matters: # No more “works on my machine” issues.\nFaster deployment and testing.\nEasier scaling across servers and cloud infrastructure.\nHow Docker Has Changed # Originally, Docker was mostly used for web apps or backend services, where developers could pre-install libraries and deploy quickly. Today, with the explosion of AI and ML, Docker is evolving into a critical tool for AI workflows, including:\nML Model Deployment: Pre-trained models can be packaged into containers and deployed anywhere.\nReproducible Experiments: AI experiments often require complex libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.), which Docker isolates perfectly.\nHardware Optimization: Containers now support GPU acceleration, making AI computations faster and more efficient.\nMicroservices \u0026amp; Scalability: Modern AI systems rely on multiple services (data ingestion, model inference, visualization), which Docker orchestrates efficiently.\nSoftware \u0026amp; Hardware Perspective # Software Perspective # Packages dependencies in a single environment.\nSupports Python, R, Java, and other languages used in AI.\nWorks with orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage clusters.\nHardware Perspective # Efficiently shares system resources without the overhead of full virtual machines.\nSupports GPU, TPU, and other AI accelerators.\nEnables portable AI solutions that run on laptops, servers, or cloud GPUs.\nMini-Project: Testing Docker for AI # To explore this, I created a Docker container for a Python AI project:\nBuilt a Docker image with Python, PyTorch, and required libraries.\nTested a sample CNN model inside the container.\nVerified reproducibility by running the container on multiple systems.\nObserved faster deployment and zero dependency issues.\nThis experiment gave me practical insight into how Docker simplifies both software setup and hardware utilization for AI applications.\nWhy This Matters Today # In the modern AI era:\nContainers allow teams to focus on model innovation rather than environment issues.\nEnterprises can deploy AI at scale without worrying about system compatibility.\nDocker combined with AI is shaping next-gen architecture, where software and hardware are tightly integrated for performance.\nConclusion # Docker has grown from a simple container tool into a vital AI enabler, bridging software development, hardware optimization, and deployment. My mini-project experience reinforced how containers simplify testing, scaling, and reproducing AI workflows.

These two branches of mathematics are essential for reasoning under uncertainty, which is at the heart of most AI applications.\nIn real-world problem solving, we often start with qualitative ideas, but when we express these in numbers — quantitative data — we begin to apply statistics. In short, statistics is the science of making decisions based on data.\nWhy Probability \u0026amp; Statistics Matter in Computer Science # In pure math, we usually deal with small-scale values (e.g., 10–20 values), which is manageable. But in computer science, especially in AI, we work with thousands to millions of data points. This creates scalability challenges, making statistics and probability crucial for:\nData Science (large-scale statistics)\nMachine Learning (glorified probability)\nAlgorithm analysis, cryptography, and system modeling\nThey help us model and analyze uncertainty, a core concern in most computing problems.\nGetting Started with Python for Stats \u0026amp; Probability # We’ll use Python as it\u0026rsquo;s general-purpose and well-supported for scientific computing.\nWe’ll also use a virtual environment (via Conda) to isolate packages and ensure compatibility across systems. This environment can be easily ported to another machine, similar to a virtual machine.\nBefore setting up the environment, it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to explore an open-source GitHub repository that provides foundational code and material:\ngit clone https://github.com/recluze/stats-prob-cs This repository includes course notebooks and examples for deeper understanding. Browsing the code will help you get comfortable with the basics.\nNote: I\u0026rsquo;m using Arch Linux. Some commands may vary slightly on other distros. For best results, use Linux or macOS over Windows.\nInstall Python: # sudo pacman -Syu python Set up a virtual environment: # wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh conda create -n stat-env python=3.11 conda activate stat-env Install required libraries: # conda install jupyterlab pandas matplotlib jupyterlab: Web-based IDE for notebooks.\npandas: For structured data manipulation.\nmatplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.\nUnderstanding Data Types # In this course, we deal with two types of data:\nArtificial Data – Collected through surveys (manual input).\nOrganic Data – Generated by systems and logs (e.g., website user activity).\nOrganic data is especially relevant in computing as it reflects real-world system behavior.\nIn machine learning, data must often be i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) for modeling.\nOne-Hot Encoding # When comparing categorical variables (e.g., male vs. female), one-hot vectors are used to represent them numerically without implying order or magnitude:\nExample:\n[male, female] = [1, 0], [0, 1] This avoids incorrect assumptions like \u0026ldquo;greater = male\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;smaller = female\u0026rdquo; which may happen if scalar values are used.\nIf we represent unordered categorical data as scalars instead of arrays, we distort the structure and meaning of that data.\nFoundations of Probability # Probability is axiomatic — based on agreed-upon rules that help us model uncertainty. It’s not about proving what\u0026rsquo;s true, but about agreeing on how to handle unknowns.\nTopics and Their Computer Science, Hardware \u0026amp; Software Perspectives # Probability and statistics touch almost every aspect of computing. Below is a brief overview of key topics in this domain, described from three perspectives: computer science use cases, hardware impact, and software support.\nThese concepts help build intelligent systems that make decisions, process uncertainty, and handle large-scale data.\n| Topic | Description | Computer Science Perspective | Hardware Perspective | Software Perspective | | | | | | | | Data Types | Different forms of data: structured, unstructured | Organize and clean datasets | Efficient memory access | pandas, NumPy | | One-Hot Vectors | Binary representation for categories | Preprocessing for ML models | Stored efficiently in RAM | Used in embeddings, TensorFlow | | Histograms \u0026amp; Visualizations | Graphical summary of data distribution | Detect patterns and anomalies | GPU acceleration for big data | matplotlib, seaborn | | Central Tendency | Mean, Median, Mode | Summarize large datasets | Requires optimized storage | numpy.mean(), pandas functions | | Variance \u0026amp; Standard Deviation | Measure of data spread | Feature scaling and normalization | Computed using parallel float ops | scikit-learn, NumPy | | Entropy \u0026amp; Information | Measure of uncertainty | Decision trees, NLP models | GPU-based entropy calculation | sklearn, scipy.stats | | Probability \u0026amp; Events | Likelihood of an event | Foundation of model prediction | RNG hardware/simulation | Python’s random, numpy.random | | Conditional Probability | Probability given a condition | Bayesian models, filters | Efficient table lookups | scikit-learn, PyMC3 | | Bayes’ Rule | Update belief with evidence | Spam filters, medical diagnosis | Uses logarithmic transformations | Naive Bayes classifiers | | Random Variables | Variables with probabilistic outcomes | Modeling random processes | Supported by dedicated chips | NumPy, PyMC3, TensorFlow | | Distributions (PMF/PDF) | Probability models for data | Classification, noise estimation | SIMD instructions for speed | scipy.stats, torch.distributions | | Joint \u0026amp; Marginal Probability | Modeling multivariate scenarios | NLP, image classification | Parallel computation across cores | pandas, statsmodels | | Expected Values | Long-run average outcomes | Policy evaluation in RL | Summation using vector units | NumPy, torch.mean | | KL Divergence | Measure of distribution difference | Regularization, GANs | Log-sum-exp ops on GPU | PyTorch, TensorFlow | | Bayesian Inference | Probabilistic belief update | Uncertainty-aware learning | Monte Carlo simulations | PyMC3, NumPyro, Edward |\nSummary # Probability and statistics are crucial for making decisions under uncertainty, which is common in all computing systems.\nThey form the mathematical backbone of machine learning and data science.\nFrom a hardware view, modern CPUs/GPUs accelerate statistical computation.\nOn the software side, Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and PyTorch simplify implementation.\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;re analyzing logs, training models, or building systems like Jetson Nano for robotics — understanding probability and statistics is essential to designing intelligent, efficient, and scalable solutions.\n**P.S:**if you spot any mistakes, feel free to point them out — we’re all here to learn together! 😊\nHaris\nFAST-NUCES\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\n🔗 Portfolio: zenvila.github.io\n🔗 GitHub: github.com/Zenvila\n🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad-7b8746291**\n🔬 Member: COLAB (Research Lab)**\n","date":"25 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/probability-and-statistics-for-ai/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Probability And Statistics For Ai","type":"posts"},{"content":" HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2 vs. HTTP/3 # A Comprehensive Comparison Web protocols have evolved significantly over the years, and the three most commonly used versions today are HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. These protocols govern how data is transmitted over the web, and each version brings improvements to speed, security, and reliability.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxarRMLmLBJuFRI5dvZM2zwU4f7FViSV2R0kLLHf_oJ5nDjxNDhUM9KlUNZiyBpVi0kMevZ6PpyRe0usjz5Su6u4lJaf1AyzRcEb9FGKh_7_ntifAd9oAyGO3_jUvDvEfFQNjW5EjabVdL5CqGWVXduOouGDYRzJ4wrsWcqMKXmK0jt2uHgGbahRqYjxw/w504-h188/Untitled.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nHTTP/1.1: The Classic Protocol\nTransport Protocol: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)\nKey Features:\nPersistent Connections: HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections, allowing multiple requests to be sent over a single TCP connection. However, it still opens new connections for each request-response pair.\nPipelining: Multiple requests can be sent before receiving responses, but the responses must be processed in the order they were sent.\nText-Based: HTTP/1.1 uses a text-based format, which is human-readable but less efficient for machine parsing.\nHead-of-Line Blocking: HTTP/1.1 suffers from head-of-line blocking, where one delayed or lost packet can block the entire stream of requests.\nFirst, you need to install curl to test these protocols: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFLWI6T17l3WB_HEc2FxQ93zlX4A1pMRyvWS8OLNisPsPRZxWmABIEr_ENKPRJ_F5cGBSCvZhDlmpWGZeRRDLYTQoT_RdE4BMeV6rbKWl2CIFDZB5Z6oRZyCvXkcxWP4rfYIi2JYHkJg8OAw9iqXPr0WcTQfIucb629_bifrthXqkhiKuxOEIyJ_SDmOA/w355-h211/Screenshot_20250126_154818.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nTesting HTTP/1.1 on GitHub (Arch-based Linux)\nResults: Here are the testing results for HTTP/1.1.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxM8lcuv4KBIviwjsroYI-qeMF3jwOtJYiAm1qqWCDc2Uh2NmsKVco2vz0IxYBV7p1ZIj-gFA4j8C_9aqtl1t8GDD63prrbKfWQClUzHgDPkHq9udBRV7boBwwErhMI6gBjMGQCSmqUh4X03b9fOWSPfQPLEPRUFq4DAVUUs2YaV90U0SB0iPQSdyzrv0/w663-h220/Screenshot_20250126_154557.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nHTTP/2: Major Improvements\nTransport Protocol: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)\nKey Features:\nMultiplexing: Multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection, reducing latency and eliminating head-of-line blocking.\nHeader Compression: HTTP/2 uses HPACK for header compression, reducing overhead and speeding up data transfer.\nStream Prioritization: Allows clients to specify the priority of streams (requests) so that more important resources can be sent first.\nServer Push: Servers can proactively send resources to the client before they are requested, improving performance for critical resources.\nBinary Protocol: HTTP/2 is binary rather than text-based, which makes it more efficient for parsing and reduces errors.\nTesting HTTP/2 on GitHub (Arch-based Linux)\nResults: Here are the testing results for HTTP/2.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoOAoXxKNELts54-wcqdwLObxYJyShkcNeeyHp_kEdnFumhQ718YVcLrChGgZsl4dFpA4ZKARcIp8sV930sDE_L6zMeeg8uHmj-8vkQ3X8uyUlCUbdjyBSBDztOK64xv2GuLb4OpLs9Y6BSAvJ7Km8-TQnMIZcoR9sa1-WOTzQ6CcmkrttZaVZfN2BPjE/w465-h153/Screenshot_20250126_154947.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nHTTP/3: The New Standard\nTransport Protocol: QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), based on UDP (User Datagram Protocol)\nKey Features:\nReduced Latency: QUIC reduces connection setup time and allows faster data transfer, especially in mobile and high-latency networks.\nMultiplexing with No Head-of-Line Blocking: Unlike TCP, UDP (used in QUIC) doesn’t block the entire connection when a packet is lost. This significantly improves performance, especially in real-time applications like video streaming and gaming.\nBuilt-in Encryption: HTTP/3 integrates TLS (Transport Layer Security) directly into the protocol, enhancing security without additional handshake delays.\nConnection Migration: QUIC allows connections to migrate between networks (e.g., from Wi-Fi to cellular) without interrupting the connection, providing a smoother user experience on mobile devices.\nTesting HTTP/3 on GitHub (Arch-based Linux)\nResults: Here are the testing results for HTTP/3.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6CrOavze5wPUm-POL3AsgC_PHwRsbsYGccdG2Vru_jxgKlsru6JNCJ3CyKdBq2c3dXjy-kmPSPpwVz1UMw65vbxG0IICv5VA42Twyfi4b3SXxZYnA5O2eF6YCfiDBxTP6x3CkZNjS9hcO8QXyJ5AffmgI8DYp5KalHXBvMhFZzk8rtUXoQkIUtIu0Nd4/w557-h184/Screenshot_20250126_155045.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nPractical Comparison\nHTTP/1.1: Although HTTP/1.1 is still widely used, it is becoming outdated due to its inefficiency in handling modern web traffic. The protocol suffers from significant delays, especially with multiple resources being requested.\nHTTP/2: HTTP/2 improves web performance significantly, especially for websites with many resources (images, scripts, etc.). Its multiplexing and header compression reduce latency, and it is more widely supported than HTTP/3. However, it still relies on TCP, which can be less efficient in some high-latency scenarios.\nHTTP/3: HTTP/3 is the future of web protocols, offering the lowest latency and best performance, especially for mobile users and in environments with high packet loss. However, it is still in the process of adoption and requires both server and client support. As seen in the case of GitHub, the transition to HTTP/3 is ongoing, and it may take time before it becomes the default for many services.\nDo check the screenshots for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. While I tested HTTP/3, it does not support it.\nWhy GitHub is Still Using HTTP/2 (TCP) Over HTTP/3 (UDP)\nAfter checking the headers for GitHub\u0026rsquo;s website, it is clear that GitHub is still using HTTP/2 over TCP and not HTTP/3, which uses UDP. This choice is likely due to several factors:\nStability: TCP is more reliable and widely supported. It guarantees data integrity and error correction, making it a safer choice for critical services like GitHub.\nCompatibility: Not all browsers, clients, and networks fully support HTTP/3. GitHub prioritizes ensuring compatibility across a wide range of devices and network environments.\nGradual Rollout of HTTP/3: Although HTTP/3 promises significant performance improvements, its adoption is still in progress. GitHub, along with many other major websites, is taking a gradual approach to adopting the new protocol to avoid potential issues.\nAdditionally, remember that HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because HTTPS uses an SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. This encryption ensures that data transferred over HTTPS is protected from interception or tampering. In contrast, HTTP does not use encryption, making it more vulnerable to security risks.\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhckwQe2PH0ir4Iuq7v9ZAiPB-oELwJMR6FhnlOZSLcVtIWY6Ym91y-lPAGoeuggYSyOmVGaezyn2bvhjls7OgB4cy47aie_MQFY6ySE3S0lNOslJeSCNkEImC1gEH_G5Fw68jBrmILaOOHhAdVakzv4SK6APlHItqbxPQp2gCHs0wLmsJn3bpJ-EkR64A/w411-h149/images.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nHere are the testing results on Gtihub server:\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjk-d7c-FdnK36kFc5nC1s-HP0pntdirnpZ1626YLHgtzwOPwCO_SphCJN4Gc9mMPinMRPfXmuRsP0Ag9b1ErGulHWuQlINfeQAp0SFFO7PHQ41pEO_ajsoTFJVaMu9YbS7EO_8SdeLDOKD90E4-iD6rZCXMkUoFDwcSIJpgjGSyRO144t20rDpx-B1yj0/w482-h92/Screenshot_20250126_160114.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nAs you can see :\nWhen you made the curl request with http://github.com/ZenTeknik, GitHub automatically redirected the request to https://github.com/ZenTeknik. This is because GitHub (and many modern websites) enforces HTTPS to ensure secure communication between the server and clients. HTTP is considered insecure, and they prefer to direct users to the secure HTTPS version.\nThe 301 Moved Permanently response code indicates that the resource has permanently moved to a new URL (the HTTPS version).\nConclusion\nThe evolution from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 and now to HTTP/3 shows a significant improvement in web performance and security. While HTTP/1.1 was the standard for many years, HTTP/2 brought major improvements in handling multiple requests efficiently. HTTP/3, with its use of QUIC and UDP, offers even lower latency and faster performance, but it is still in the process of widespread adoption.\nFor now, HTTP/2 over TCP remains the default for many services, including GitHub, due to its stability and compatibility. As HTTP/3 continues to mature, it will likely become the standard for most modern websites in the near future.\nHaris\nFAST (NUCES)\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\nGitHub: https://github.com/Zenvila\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad786\nMember: COLAB (Research Lab)\n","date":"24 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/http11-vs-http2-vs-http3/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Http11 Vs Http2 Vs Http3","type":"posts"},{"content":" Numerical Computing for AI # Introduction # Numerical computing in computer science involves using computers to perform calculations on real numbers, which are often approximated due to the limitations of computer representation. This field is crucial for various scientific and engineering applications where analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain.\nIn this course, we mainly focus on what numerical computing actually is and why it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;numerical computing.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalytical vs. Numerical Mathematics # The math that we have done so far (like calculus and multivariable calculus) is analytical math. In a sense, we use numeric values and insert them into equations to simplify and get a precise solution. Analytical math is good when we have limited variables or objects and need a simplified solution.\nTake Newton\u0026rsquo;s Second Law:\nF = ma\nThis works well with two variables. But if we add a third object and try to calculate a radius or interaction, it becomes difficult to solve analytically. That’s where numerical methods come in. These methods use approximations to solve problems that are too complex for traditional analytical solutions. These approximations are very close to the actual answers.\nSo why do we need approximations? Because analytical methods are only feasible for limited objects. For large-scale problems, mathematicians use numerical methods, and when these methods are implemented via computers, it\u0026rsquo;s called numerical computation.\nScalars and Vectors # To begin understanding numerical computing, we start with the concepts of scalars and vectors.\nScalars: A single value, with no direction. In machine learning, if we consider an equation like area = length * width, the result (area) is a scalar.\nVectors: A collection of scalars, often having direction. In machine learning, even if we are using length and width together, they are treated as a vector.\nMatrices # A matrix is not just rows and columns; it acts as a transformer of vectors.\nWhen a matrix is multiplied by a vector, the result is a new vector that represents a transformation — involving direction, magnitude, or both. Entire fields like ML and computer vision are built upon these transformations.\nLinearity # What is linearity? Suppose we have two parallel lines. If, after applying a matrix transformation, the lines remain parallel and preserve the origin, this is linearity.\nEigenvectors and Eigenvalues # Eigenvector: A special vector that doesn’t change direction when a transformation (matrix) is applied. Only the magnitude changes.\nEigenvalue: Tells how much the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk during the transformation.\nApplications:\nUsed in graph algorithms like PageRank.\nGoogle Search is built around this.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) uses eigenvectors to find the direction of maximum variance.\nSummary:\nEigenvectors = direction of patterns\nEigenvalues = strength of those patterns\nScalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors # Scalars are single numbers.\nVectors are collections of scalars.\nMatrices are collections of vectors.\nTensors are higher-dimensional collections of matrices.\nFloating-Point Representation # How does a computer store floating-point numbers like 10.665?\nIEEE 754 Standard # Stored as:\n(-1)^sign × mantissa × 2^exponent\nParts:\nSign bit: 0 = positive, 1 = negative\nMantissa: Stores the digits\nExponent: Tells where the decimal point goes\nExample:\n10.665 in binary: 1010.1010101... becomes 1.010101 × 2^3\nDynamic Decimal Point: Allows storing both very large and very small numbers using exponents.\nHardware Perspective # FPU (Floating-Point Unit): Special circuit in the CPU for float operations.\nRegisters: Store mantissa and exponent.\nInstruction Set: Includes operations like FADD, FMUL.\nPrecision Modes: FP16, FP32, FP64 (used in AI)\nSoftware Perspective # Handled by programming languages and libraries.\nData Types # float16: Half precision\nfloat32: Common in ML\nfloat64: Scientific computing\nPython Example:\nimport numpy as np x = np.float32(10.665) y = np.float64(10.665) Libraries # NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow handle precision, rounding, and overflow/underflow automatically.\nErrors and warnings can be managed using np.seterr()\nHDF5 Format # Used when working with Keras/TensorFlow.\nStores: model architecture, weights, optimizer state.\nMore scalable than NumPy arrays (which reside entirely in memory).\nCan load parts of the dataset dynamically from disk (like SSD), improving memory efficiency.\nDistance Metrics # Euclidean Distance # Straight-line distance\nFormula: √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\nUsed in: KNN, K-Means, recommendation systems\nWeakness: sensitive to different feature scales, fails in high dimensions\nManhattan Distance # Grid-based distance (L1 norm)\nFormula: |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|\nUsed in: sparse data (text, images), Lasso Regression\nWeakness: ignores angles and direction\nMatrix Decomposition Methods # LU Decomposition (Doolittle) # A = LU where:\nL = Lower triangular (diagonal = 1)\nU = Upper triangular\nUsed for solving Ax = b\nCrout Method # A = LU where:\nU has diagonal of 1s Cholesky Decomposition # A = LLᵀ\nFor symmetric positive-definite matrices\nUsed in Gaussian processes, Kalman filters\nGauss-Seidel Method # Iterative method to solve Ax = b\nImproves guess step-by-step using latest calculated values\nUse in AI: # Optimization problems\nSparse systems like recommendation engines\nReinforcement learning with constraints\nRoot Finding # Find x such that f(x) = 0\nMethods:\nBisection Method: split interval in half\nNewton-Raphson Method: uses derivatives\nSecant Method: approximates without derivatives\nIntermediate Value Theorem # If a continuous function changes sign between two points a and b, then it must cross zero somewhere between them.\nFoundation of Bisection Method\nGuarantees solution in a given interval\nNewton’s Method (Root Finding) # Uses:\nx1 = x0 - f(x0)/f\u0026rsquo;(x0)\nFast convergence, but needs derivative\nInspired gradient descent in ML\nInterpolation # Estimate value between known data points\nUsed in:\nMissing data filling\nSignal smoothing\nGraphics, animations\nNewton’s Interpolation # Builds a polynomial that fits multiple points\nFlexible and used to smooth curves\nTaylor Series # Approximates complex functions using polynomials\nUsed in:\nNewton’s method\nApproximating sin(x), e^x\nSolving differential equations\nNumerical Differentiation # Estimate derivatives using data points\nFormula: f\u0026rsquo;(x) ≈ (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h\nUsed in:\nOptimization\nTraining ML models\nGradient Descent # Method for minimizing errors\nSteps:\nStart with a guess\nCompute the gradient\nUpdate weights\nRepeat until convergence\nUsed in training neural networks\nLibraries handle this internally (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)\nSanity Check # Quick test to verify if results make basic sense\nPrevents obvious errors\nUsed in data validation, debugging, and before/after training **P.S:**if you spot any mistakes, feel free to point them out — we’re all here to learn together!

Most of us start with little to no understanding, myself included. That curiosity led me to delve into the realm of Computer Architecture and Organization (COA). Through this blog, I aim to bridge the gap in understanding computer hardware and how it collaborates with software, making it easier for everyone to comprehend. Computer Architecture:\nComputer architecture focuses on the fundamental behavior of computer systems. It involves designing and implementing various parts of a computer to ensure they work together seamlessly. Computer Organization:\nOn the other hand, computer organization deals with the structural relationships within a computer system. It focuses on how operational attributes are connected to realize the architectural specifications. Key Components:\nProcessors:\nThink of processors as the brain of the system. Also known as Central Processing Units (CPUs), they execute instructions from computer programs, performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and I/O operations.\nMemory:\nMemory stores instructions for the processor to execute. It acts as a temporary workspace where data and program instructions are stored and accessed.\nI/O Peripherals:\nInput and output devices facilitate communication between the computer and the external world. They allow users to input data and receive output from the computer system. Architectural Concepts:\nISA (Instruction Set Architecture) vs. HSA (Hardware Set Architecture):\nISA defines the interface between the software and hardware of a computer system, while HSA refers to the physical implementation of the hardware components.\nHistorical Perspectives:\nAnalytical Engine: Proposed by Charles Babbage and aided by Ada Lovelace, this was the first general-purpose mechanical engine.\nVon Neumann Architecture: Characterized by a single system bus, it allows only one task to be performed at a time.\nTo check visually: https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/von-neumann-architecture\nNon-Von Neumann Architecture (Harvard Architecture): Features separate memory units, multiple paths for faster processing, and cache to enhance speed. To check visually: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture Conclusion:\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s modern era, we predominantly use the Non-Von Neumann architecture, also known as the Harvard architecture. While computer architecture encompasses a vast array of topics, this blog covers crucial points to enhance understanding.

Basically, we will explore live updates of the host kernel and also go through some of the different optimizations that have been done to improve boot time, especially specialized for the specific ECI device.\nECI: # This is a software platform that leverages technologies like virtualization and containerization to manage control execution as containerized microservices in industrial environments. We will also conclude with whether there is anything more to improve and what are large areas that can further enhance boot time.\nLet’s First Start With the Motivation – Why? # In both public and private clouds, once the workload is started and the virtual machines are running, people do not want the host environment to change — they try to keep it the same as long as possible.\nBut updating the host kernel is a severe distraction, especially due to the very large downtime it can cause for the virtual machines.\nHowever, updating the host kernel obviously brings security, functionality, and performance benefits — which not all of the alternative methods like kernel patching deliver, as kernel patching is mostly meant for critical security fixes and bug fixes.\nWhat is Kernel Patching? # Kernel patching is used to address bug fixes, security vulnerabilities, or to introduce new features or functionalities. Kernel patching can be performed in two ways:\nBy updating the entire kernel (requires a system reboot)\nThrough live patching, which allows updates to be applied without interrupting the system\nTwo Ways to Update the Host Kernel: # Live Migration\nLive Update\nLive Migration: # Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine from one physical host to another without causing too much disruption. It has major advantages, especially in handling physical hardware issues.\nSo, this is not the problem here — what we have done is update the host kernel via live update. We don’t try to update the kernel in systems that already have hardware issues.\nLive Updates: # Live updates of the host kernel work by pausing and snapshotting the virtual machines running on the host, then kexec booting into the new kernel and restoring/resuming energy to the virtual machines.\nAdvantages: # No need for extra resources (unlike live migration)\nNo extra machines required\nLess bandwidth consumption\nOther Issues: # If PCI devices (Peripheral Component Interconnect) are passed through a virtual machine using VFIO pass-through, we need to preserve its IOM state (operational state of a network interface).\nSolution Using KVM Form and Kernel Persistent Memory # What is Kernel Persistent Memory? # Persistent memory is a type of computer memory that retains data even after power is turned off.

In this post, we’ll walk step-by-step through the fundamentals of Kubernetes, and by the end, we’ll deploy a simple Ubuntu application using Minikube locally on Arch Linux.\n🧠 What is Kubernetes? # Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google and now maintained by the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).\nIt automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.\nThink of it as an orchestrator for Docker containers — instead of running containers manually, Kubernetes manages everything for you.\n🛠️ Understanding the Architecture # Kubernetes has a master node and worker nodes.\nThe master node manages the entire cluster: scheduling, updating, and controlling the system.\nThe worker nodes can be your frontend, backend, or middleware containers.\nAll nodes run containers — and these containers are organized into pods.\nYou only need to manage the master node (via scripts or kubectl), and it takes care of the rest!\n📍 Real-World Scenario # Let’s say someone makes a request to your frontend (a frontend container). The API server receives this request and checks in the cluster for available containers.\nThis information is stored in etcd, a key-value database that stores the entire cluster’s state.\nIf a container is available, it schedules a pod using the scheduler.\nThere’s also a controller manager that monitors all nodes and pods. It ensures:\nPods restart if they fail\nThe desired number of replicas are maintained\nThe system self-heals\nIn short:\nClusters contain multiple nodes, each node contains pods, and each pod contains one or more containers.\n🧩 Kubernetes Core Concepts # 🔹 What is a Pod? # The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.\nCan contain one or more containers that share network and storage.\nTypically contains one container in most real-world use cases.\nWhy use Pods?\nThey wrap your container and allow Kubernetes to manage them effectively.\n🔹 What is a Deployment? # A higher-level object that manages pods.\nSupports:\nSelf-healing (auto-restarts failed pods)\nRolling updates\nScaling\n🔹 What is a Service? # A way to expose your pods to the network. Types of Services:\nClusterIP – Internal access only\nNodePort – Access via node IP + port\nLoadBalancer – Uses an external cloud-based load balancer\n🔹 What is a ConfigMap? # A ConfigMap stores key-value configuration data that your app can use.\nIt allows you to separate config from code, making updates easier without rebuilding your container.\n🔹 What is a Secret? # A Secret is used to store sensitive information like:\nPasswords\nOAuth tokens\nAPI keys\nIt’s like a secure vault within your cluster for credentials.\n🔹 What are Rolling Updates? # Rolling updates allow you to update applications without downtime.\nIt gradually replaces old pods with new ones, so some instances are always available to serve users.\n💻 Setting Up Kubernetes on Arch Linux with Minikube # ✅ Why Minikube? # Minikube is perfect for local development.\nIt provides a lightweight and portable environment to experiment with Kubernetes without needing a cloud provider.\nThink of Minikube as a lab where you can learn Kubernetes hands-on.\n✅ Why not jump directly to kubectl? # Because:\nkubectl is just a command-line tool to interact with a cluster.\nIt does not set up a cluster itself.\nMinikube creates the cluster, while kubectl controls it.\n🔧 Install Minikube and kubectl on Arch Linux # Run the following command:\nsudo pacman -S minikube kubectl ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750049992151/91882e73-ee03-42aa-8f76-b5989dca8444.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nStart Your Local Kubernetes Cluster # Minikube uses Docker as the default driver.\nNote: kubectl does not use Docker; it uses the CRI (Container Runtime Interface).\nStart Minikube:\nminikube start --driver=docker ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750050385793/7e1d154f-0fdf-4e5d-94ec-6ff5ad2dda71.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nThis sets up:\nA Kubernetes control plane\nA Kubernetes node (running in a VM or container)\n⚠️ If errors occur, make sure your Linux headers are updated or use modprobe to manage kernel modules.\nAlso ensure Docker is enabled and started:\nsudo systemctl start docker sudo systemctl enable docker Verify Minikube is Running # Check the status:\nminikube status ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750050410102/7ff271d8-3107-49de-9d48-5daf28af3d6c.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nCheck the cluster:\nkubectl get nodes ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750050484194/800ba81f-9bbf-4b47-a3ed-f3aded78f77e.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nIf you see something like minikube Ready, then you\u0026rsquo;re good to go!\nDeploy a Simple Ubuntu Pod # As Kubernetes uses YAML files for configuration, we’ll write one to create a Pod.\n📄 Create ubuntu-pod.yaml: # apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: ubuntu-pod spec: containers: - name: ubuntu-container image: ubuntu command: [\u0026#34;sleep\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3600\u0026#34;] Explanation:\nCreates a pod using the Ubuntu image\nRuns the command sleep 3600 to keep it alive for an hour\nApply the Pod # kubectl apply -f ubuntu-pod.yaml ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750050513599/4da0d774-93cb-4e08-904b-c2ca0c3cc03a.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nCheck if it’s running:\nkubectl get pods ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750050569787/3d19fd1a-3368-440e-af20-a2d6dee069ef.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\n🐚 Enter the Ubuntu Pod # kubectl exec -it ubuntu-pod -- bash ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750050601739/4970f2a5-5f55-4e02-a563-3a3e306af217.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nNow you’re inside the Ubuntu container.

It efficiently transfers and synchronizes files across different systems or locations, making it ideal for managing backups and handling large data sets.\nUnderstanding Rsync # Rsync stands for Remote Synchronization and is commonly used when you need to transfer files between different servers. For instance, if you have two servers—one local and the other remotely located—you can use rsync to transfer files seamlessly between them.\nKnown for its speed, flexibility, and efficiency, rsync is particularly popular when dealing with large files and maintaining backups. The tool ensures that files are transferred efficiently, preserving important attributes such as permissions, ownership, and timestamps.\nKey Features of Rsync # Optimized File Transfer: Rsync sends only the changes made to files rather than re-transmitting the entire file.\nPreserves Metadata: It maintains file permissions, ownership, and timestamps.\nPartial Transfers: If a file is modified after the initial transfer, rsync only sends the updated changes, saving time and bandwidth.\nWhy Use Rsync? # Although you can transfer files without rsync, its main advantage lies in its ability to update only the changed portions of files. For example, if you have a 1GB file and you modify just a small part, rsync will update only the changes on the remote server instead of replacing the entire file. This makes it highly efficient for repetitive synchronization tasks.\nInitial Speed Consideration # The first-time transfer might seem slower because rsync performs a thorough synchronization. However, subsequent transfers are much faster due to its incremental update mechanism.\nRsync Syntax # The basic syntax of rsync is as follows:\nrsync source destination\nTo use rsync for transferring files to a remote server, you can also use Windows or another remote server, but here I am using SSH. You can refer to my blog on SSH setup for guidance. Blog link: https://sysadmininsights.blogspot.com/2024/06/sshsecure-shell.html Logging into the Remote Server # To log into your SSH server, use the following command:\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRCS79V2xSDxknB1uCIW427rhyphenhyphenoKkX5A3lju0QuIkTyRfnyE4nYvN0KOQMef59kpKI-H3JMWmQ8h8_AAcfqt8qkISV2k_Ea0oLo2pRiqBqrEIyzrkTKmrAy9gmOqvIMRsCv70U4wcJ7zavRdtvcklIwS2mIXT_7mmMqPQBAVt5u9EdeXPjGGylzbVun_o/w399-h242/Screenshot%20from%202024-09-29%2004-20-31.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nOnce logged in, you can start transferring files from your local server to the remote server using rsync.\nFile Transfer from Local Server to Remote Server # To transfer a single file from your local server to a remote server, use:\nrsync -avz /home/haris/DS-class/link-list.cpp haris@192.168.18.111:/home/haris ![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZW7cToDZbALShR64rDOYCdOW6DkEYQEAJ9KcszCCqO6uR6Mlhjxepomu3kp4GzjxfQqtUP4HdMroRfjbzE-VEWr4HdxfX1tSJJaitGk_qfLTGFzdJs1wICVnzjOG-s8Ili2JwXkXcNPq_FxM4sw60sF8yusBjgJbKLBXe5w8Vl9R3Coolu1IiYB6f6EA/w640-h117/Screenshot%20from%202024-09-29%2004-23-05.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nFolder Transfer from Local to Remote # To transfer an entire folder, use:\nrsync -avz /home/haris/DS-class/ haris@192.168.18.*** :/home/haris ![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6lBg4Yrk9FMtlXfGa_A6ou_f2azkP-Sen3ltvzsfOHZzX_xgeEbSzHKVH8Tx6uSzSw15RJA56UR8-BBWz5QcgzBycnQ31iifGtfFtiQOvWqhUFvcb3MSrSY-QQhJrMzVg5rfU43xfxxaAniJ-U5KQdL6HC2BGLmgGDNDnA1DinmHSLkGjcEuaRvQ_lsA/w469-h225/Screenshot%20from%202024-09-29%2004-25-13.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nUsing Verbose Mode # If you want detailed information about the transfer process, add the -v (verbose) option:\ncomm : rsync -v /home/haris/folder-name/file-name haris@192.168.18.111:/home/haris\n![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdcUQXnPaOYgElnLv5mjWzMybpu8BjR3PsOC-2GxLk4_-xoP0lQpIem2y4Jepr534x4FTaGEvpPgjrIfKVWlVfU-ul7X1zdYAwSh6TL5_y2Eu3BROrOuLf985seJEahRUNMBRjK21IbEzlBgrItBfkcWGic2GMkjcuoQTvAtcH66UJ1zhTxXYi2uwK5mM/w803-h123/Screenshot%20from%202024-09-29%2004-29-16.png align=\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;)\nVerbose mode provides you with insights on which files are being transferred and their respective statuses.\nConclusion # Rsync is an efficient tool for file transfer and synchronization, known for its speed, flexibility, and ability to update only changed parts of files.

Chef allows system administrators and DevOps engineers to define infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency, reliability, and scalability in IT environments.\nKey Components of Chef # Chef Workstation: This is the development environment where administrators write and test their infrastructure code using the Chef development kit (ChefDK).\nChef Server: The central repository that stores all configuration data and policies. It acts as the intermediary between the Chef Workstation and Chef Clients.\nChef Client: The agent installed on each node (server or device) that communicates with the Chef Server to fetch and apply configuration policies.\nCookbooks: Collections of recipes and related resources that define how a system should be configured. Each recipe contains step-by-step instructions for configuring a specific aspect of the system.\nRecipes: The individual components of a cookbook that define specific resources and their desired states.\nResources: The fundamental units within a recipe, such as packages, services, or files, that define the desired state of various aspects of a system.\nAdvantages of Chef # Automation: Automates repetitive tasks, reducing the chances of human error and increasing efficiency.\nConsistency: Ensures that all systems are configured identically, preventing configuration drift.\nScalability: Easily manages large-scale environments with thousands of nodes.\nFlexibility: Supports a wide range of platforms and allows customization through code.\nIntegration: Integrates seamlessly with cloud providers, CI/CD pipelines, and other DevOps tools.\nConfiguring Chef on a Linux Terminal # To configure Chef on a Linux terminal, you need to install Chef Workstation, set up a Chef repository, create cookbooks, write recipes, upload cookbooks to the Chef Server, bootstrap a node, and run the Chef Client on the node.\nProgress Chef vs. Puppet # Both Chef and Puppet are leading configuration management tools, but they have some key differences:\nLanguage:\nChef: Uses Ruby-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for writing configuration scripts.\nPuppet: Uses its own declarative language.\nApproach:\nChef: Follows a procedural approach, defining \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; to achieve the desired state.\nPuppet: Follows a declarative approach, defining \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; the desired state should be.\nArchitecture:\nChef: Client-server model with a pull-based approach, where clients pull configurations from the server.\nPuppet: Uses both client-server and standalone architectures, with clients typically pulling configurations from the server.\nLearning Curve:\nChef: Can be more complex to learn due to its Ruby-based DSL.\nPuppet: Generally easier to learn due to its simpler, more intuitive declarative language.\nCommunity and Ecosystem:\nChef: Has a strong community and integrates well with other DevOps tools.\nPuppet: Also has a robust community with a rich ecosystem of modules.\nConclusion # Progress Chef is a versatile tool for automating infrastructure management, providing consistency, scalability, and integration capabilities. While both Chef and Puppet serve similar purposes, their differences in language, approach, and architecture may influence the choice of tool depending on the specific needs and preferences of the organization. P.S. # If you spot any mistakes, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to point them out.

It is open-source and uses a declarative approach—you define what end result you want, unlike imperative tools, which define how to get there step-by-step.\nTerraform is a tool used for infrastructure provisioning.\nFor example:\nYou’ve started a project and want to deploy several servers to run a microservices application. You run Docker containers to bring the service up. Suppose you decide to build this on the AWS platform to host your entire infrastructure.\nIn this case, the DevOps engineer prepares and provisions the infrastructure, and the developer deploys the software on it. So, where does Terraform come in?\nTerraform is used in the first part—infrastructure provisioning.\nWhat is the Difference Between Terraform and Ansible? # By definition, they may sound similar. Both are Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools used for provisioning, configuring, and managing infrastructure.\nHowever:\nTerraform is mainly an infrastructure provisioning tool. It can also deploy tools, but its core strength lies in setting up infrastructure.\nAnsible is mainly a configuration tool. Once the infrastructure is provisioned, Ansible configures it: installs software, deploys apps, and handles updates.\nAnsible is more mature, while Terraform is relatively newer and more advanced in orchestration.\nIn best DevOps practices, both tools are used together to cover the entire setup end-to-end.\nProvisioning and Configuration with Terraform and Ansible (Locally) # We\u0026rsquo;ll now build and deploy a service locally using Terraform and Ansible.\nProvisioning: Terraform Creates Ubuntu Container with SSH # Step 1: Install Required Packages # sudo pacman -S terraform docker ansible openssh Make sure Docker is running:\nsudo systemctl start docker sudo systemctl enable docker Step 2: Generate SSH Key (if not already) # ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -q -N \u0026#34;\u0026#34; This creates:\n~/.ssh/id_rsa → private key\n~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub → public key\nExplanation:\n| Part | Explanation | | | | | ssh-keygen | Creates SSH key pairs | | -t rsa | Uses RSA encryption | | -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa | Saves private key here | | -q | Quiet mode | | -N \u0026quot;\u0026quot; | No passphrase (empty password) |\nmain.tf # provider \u0026#34;docker\u0026#34; {} resource \u0026#34;docker_image\u0026#34; \u0026#34;ubuntu\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;ubuntu:20.04\u0026#34; } resource \u0026#34;docker_container\u0026#34; \u0026#34;ubuntu_container\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;ubuntu-terraform\u0026#34; image = docker_image.ubuntu.name ports { internal = 22 external = 2222 } network_mode = \u0026#34;bridge\u0026#34; command = [ \u0026#34;sh\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;, \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-EOT apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt install -y openssh-server sudo \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir -p /var/run/sshd \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo \u0026#34;PermitRootLogin yes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo \u0026#34;root:root\u0026#34; | chpasswd \u0026amp;\u0026amp; service ssh start \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tail -f /dev/null EOT ] } versions.tf # terraform { required_providers { docker = { source = \u0026#34;kreuzwerker/docker\u0026#34; } } required_version = \u0026#34;\u0026gt;= 1.0.0\u0026#34; } Initialize and Apply Terraform # terraform init terraform apply -auto-approve Confirm Container and SSH Access # docker ps It should show:\nPORTS: 0.0.0.0:2222-\u0026gt;22/tcp Connect using:\nssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 # Password: root If you get a shell, SSH works.\nCheck Internet in Container # docker exec -it ubuntu-terraform ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 If this fails, run:\ndocker exec -it ubuntu-terraform bash echo \u0026#34;nameserver 8.8.8.8\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/resolv.conf apt update Now your internet inside the container should work.\nConfiguration: Ansible to Set Up Apache in Ubuntu Container # Now that we have provisioned the infrastructure locally, we move to the next step: configuring it using Ansible.\nCreate Ansible Directory # mkdir ansible \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd ansible Create Inventory File – inventory.ini # [web] localhost ansible_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=root ansible_password=root ansible_connection=ssh ansible_ssh_common_args=\u0026#39;-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\u0026#39; Explanation of Inventory # | Line | Description | | | | | [web] | Group name | | localhost | Logical hostname | | ansible_host=127.0.0.1 | IP address | | ansible_port=2222 | Docker SSH port | | ansible_user=root | Username | | ansible_password=root | Password | | ansible_connection=ssh | Connection type | | ansible_ssh_common_args=... | Skip manual key confirmation |\nCreate Playbook – install_apache.yml # - name: Install and start Apache Web Server via raw shell commands hosts: web gather_facts: no tasks: - name: Update APT cache raw: apt update - name: Install Apache2 raw: apt install -y apache2 - name: Start Apache now raw: service apache2 start - name: Verify Apache is running raw: service apache2 status || true Run the Playbook # Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re inside the ansible/ directory:\nbashCopyEditansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_apache.yml Test Apache # curl http://127.0.0.1:2222 You should see the default Apache welcome page.\nSummary: What You’ve Achieved # Provisioned an Ubuntu container with SSH using Terraform\nInstalled and started Apache inside it using Ansible\nVerified that Apache is running and serving web pages\nConclusion # This blog demonstrated how to integrate Terraform and Ansible to provision and configure a local server environment. Terraform handled the creation of the containerized infrastructure, while Ansible managed the configuration tasks such as installing and starting Apache.\nThis approach is practical for learning DevOps workflows and testing deployments locally before scaling to cloud platforms. Using both tools together ensures full automation from infrastructure setup to software deployment. In upcoming sections, this setup can be extended to platforms like AWS, offering even more powerful automation capabilities.\nP.S.\nIf you spot any mistakes, feel free to point them out — we’re all here to learn together! 😊\nHaris\nFAST-NUCES\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\n🔗 Portfolio: zenvila.github.io🔗 GitHub: github.com/Zenvila🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad-7b8746291**\n🔬 Member: COLAB (Research Lab)**\n","date":"15 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/terraform-and-ansible/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Terraform And Ansible","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/arm/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ARM","type":"tags"},{"content":" The Challenge # Testing embedded AI for drones and robotics requires expensive ARM hardware.

Check out my intro blog:\nSSH Blog : https://hashnode.com/edit/cm7vvn7eg000209l1fr88hp1o\nWhat is SSH Tunneling? # SSH Tunneling is like building a secure underground pipe between two computers. Imagine two laptops — one in Lahore and the other in Karachi — and we want to connect them even if they are on different networks or behind NAT/firewalls. With SSH tunneling, you can securely forward a port from one machine to another over the internet without exposing ports directly to the world.\nWhy SSH Tunneling Instead of Simple SSH Port Forwarding? # Traditional SSH Port Forwarding only works if the other device is on the same network or has a public IP. But often:\nYou\u0026rsquo;re on different Wi-Fi or ISPs (like college vs home)\nThe remote device is behind NAT or firewall\nYou don’t know the public IP of the other device\nThat’s where SSH tunneling with third-party jump servers like serveo.net comes in — no public IP needed!\nWhat is Serveo.net? # Serveo.net is a free reverse SSH tunneling service that acts like a middleman. It gives you a public-facing URL or port and forwards all the traffic to your local machine over SSH.\nNo need to install anything — just use regular ssh command!\nScenario: Haris (Client) ⬅️➡️ Dawood (Host) # We have two laptops:\n💻 Dawood’s Laptop — the one we want to connect to (host)\n💻 Haris’s Laptop — the one we connect from (client)\nWe’ll build a tunnel so Haris can SSH into Dawood’s laptop, even if they’re on completely different networks.\n🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide # 🔍 Step 1: Check SSH is Enabled on Dawood’s Laptop # On Dawood\u0026rsquo;s laptop, run:\nsudo systemctl status ssh If not active, start it:\nsudo systemctl start ssh You can also check if port 22 is listening:\nsudo netstat -tuln | grep :22 If it doesn’t show anything, install OpenSSH:\nsudo pacman -Syu openssh-server Step 2: Know Your IP (Optional) # If you want to check your public IP manually:\nifconfig But remember: Serveo removes the need to know public IPs altogether. This is just for knowledge.\nStep 3: Create SSH Tunnel from Dawood’s Laptop to Serveo # Now, on Dawood\u0026rsquo;s laptop, run this:\nssh -R 5678:localhost:22 serveo.net Explanation:\n-R 5678:localhost:22 → This means: any connection made to serveo.net:5678 should be forwarded to localhost:22 on Dawood’s machine.\nserveo.net → The middleman server doing the tunneling.\nOutput should look like:\nForwarding TCP connections from serveo.net:5678 Keep this terminal open — the tunnel is now active.\nWhat Just Happened? # We told Serveo:\n“Hey, when anyone connects to port 5678 on your server, forward that request to Dawood’s port 22 on his local machine.”\nSo now the world has access to Dawood’s SSH (securely) — only through this tunnel.\nStep 4: Connect from Haris’s Laptop # Now, on Haris’s laptop, run this:\nssh -p 5678 dawood@serveo.net It will ask for Dawood’s Linux password (the username must match his system).\nYou are now connected remotely to Dawood’s machine via SSH, using the tunnel!\nNow using rsync Over Tunnel (File Transfer) :\nTo copy files from Haris to Dawood:\nrsync -avz -e \u0026#34;ssh -p 5678\u0026#34; ~/my_folder dawood@serveo.net:~/destination_folder To pull files from Dawood to Haris:\nrsync -avz -e \u0026#34;ssh -p 5678\u0026#34; dawood@serveo.net:~/remote_folder ~/local_folder Warnings # Tunnel breaks if Dawood closes terminal\nNo authentication system on serveo.net, so only use for temporary or trusted access\nUse strong passwords or even better, set up SSH key authentication\nNote: It’s not just serveo.net that you can use—there are many other services like ngrok and localXpose that help you bypass restrictions and create secure, encrypted connections. These tools are especially useful when dealing with NATs or firewalls, particularly if you need to connect across different types of network restrictions.\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749231949407/d0212a9e-75b8-4bd3-9876-0f9d52dc747a.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nP.S.\nIf you spot any mistakes, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to point them out.

Here’s an overview of the key modules and what I learned from each.\n1. Cloud Concepts and OCI Overview # The course began with an introduction to cloud computing models — including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).\nIt explained how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure delivers computing resources on demand through its global regions and availability domains. Each region represents a geographical location, and every availability domain acts as an independent data center with its own power, cooling, and network resources.\nThis module helped me understand the advantages of the cloud, such as elasticity, high availability, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency, and how OCI provides these through its well-planned infrastructure.\n2. Compute Services # The Compute module focused on OCI’s ability to run workloads on flexible computing resources. I learned how users can create and manage virtual machines (VMs) or bare metal instances depending on their performance needs.\nThe course explained key features such as:\nInstance Configuration and Pooling for creating scalable application environments.\nAutoscaling, which automatically adjusts resources based on traffic demand.\nLoad Balancing, which distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability.\nThis module gave me a solid understanding of how OCI Compute helps build scalable and fault-tolerant applications.\n3. Storage Services # The Storage module introduced the different types of storage that OCI offers:\nObject Storage for unstructured data like backups, logs, and images.\nBlock Volume for high-performance storage attached to compute instances.\nFile Storage for shared file systems accessible across multiple instances.\nArchive Storage for long-term retention of infrequently accessed data.\nI also learned about data durability, redundancy, and lifecycle management, which ensure that data remains available and protected across regions. Understanding the balance between performance, cost, and durability was an essential takeaway from this section.\n4. Networking # The Networking module was one of the most important sections of the course. It explained the role of the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) — OCI’s private, customizable network environment that connects all deployed resources.\nKey concepts included:\nSubnets for organizing and isolating resources.\nGateways (Internet, NAT, Service, and Dynamic Routing Gateways) for connecting to external or private networks.\nSecurity Lists and Network Security Groups (NSGs) for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.\nLoad Balancers for distributing workloads evenly.\nThis module gave me a deeper understanding of how cloud networking works and how OCI ensures security and connectivity within cloud environments.\n5. Database Services # The Database module explored Oracle’s advanced database offerings. I learned about:\nAutonomous Database — a self-managing, self-patching, and self-tuning database that eliminates manual administration.\nOracle Database Cloud Service, which provides full control over Oracle databases in the cloud.\nMySQL HeatWave, a high-performance, in-memory query accelerator that runs analytics directly on transactional data.\nThis section highlighted how Oracle leverages its decades of database expertise to provide fast, secure, and reliable database services for both traditional and modern workloads.\n6. Security and Identity # Security in the cloud is critical, and this module covered OCI’s approach to maintaining it through Identity and Access Management (IAM).\nI learned how policies, users, groups, compartments, and dynamic groups are used to manage access to resources. The concept of the Shared Responsibility Model clarified how both Oracle and the customer play roles in maintaining security.\nOther important features included encryption at rest and in transit, audit logs, and fault domains for protecting workloads from hardware-level failures.\n7. Pricing, SLAs, and Support # This module focused on OCI’s pricing model, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and support tiers.\nIt explained how Oracle provides transparent and predictable pricing across services and offers multiple support levels based on customer needs.\nI also learned about the Always Free Tier, which allows users to experiment with key OCI services at no cost, and usage monitoring tools that help control and optimize spending.\nThe SLA discussion emphasized Oracle’s strong guarantees for availability, manageability, and performance, reflecting its commitment to enterprise-grade reliability.\n8. Shared Responsibility and Best Practices # The final module reinforced the Shared Responsibility Model, defining what Oracle secures (infrastructure and hardware) versus what customers secure (applications, data, and access).\nIt also introduced cloud governance best practices such as compartment design, policy management, tagging resources, and monitoring usage.\nThese concepts are essential for maintaining security, efficiency, and compliance in cloud operations.\nConclusion # Completing the OCI 2025 Foundations Associate certification gave me a well-rounded understanding of how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure operates — from its global architecture to its compute, storage, networking, and security services.\nEach module built a deeper appreciation of how Oracle has designed its cloud to meet the demands of modern applications while maintaining flexibility, cost control, and performance.\nThis certification represents a strong first step toward mastering Oracle Cloud. Going forward, I plan to explore the OCI Architect Associate track to gain deeper, hands-on knowledge in designing and deploying enterprise-level solutions on OCI.\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1761897112304/bd42b284-cec2-41f0-a70e-6aba3cfe0fa4.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1761897136539/d6e995f9-5523-413d-acee-6650ba0b51f8.png align=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;)\nHaris\nFAST-NUCES\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\n🔗 Portfolio: zenvila.github.io\n🔗 GitHub: github.com/Zenvila\n🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad-7b8746291\n🔬 Member: COLAB (Research Lab)\n","date":"27 September 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-journey-with-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-oci-foundations-associate-2025/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My Journey With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Oci Foundations Associate 2025","type":"posts"},{"content":" Linear Algebra for AI # What Does Math Have to Do with Machine Learning? # All programming involves math at some level — and machine learning is no exception.\nIn fact, machine learning is programming by optimization, and to understand optimization, we need mathematics.\nTo understand what optimization is, how it works, and how machines learn, we need a strong mathematical foundation. In this series, we will cover the first mathematical tool: Linear Algebra, which plays a major role in understanding optimization and its use in machine learning.\nLinear Algebra # Linear algebra helps us understand:\nThe object being optimized\nHow data is structured\nHow models are built and computed\nTakeaway for Today # Linear Algebra is important, and it is not the same as high-school algebra.\nWhy do we care about linear algebra?\nBecause it is the mathematics of arrays — and in machine learning, everything is made of arrays:\nThe data, like an image, is an array\nThe models are collections of arrays\nEven the internal computations of these models are performed using arrays\nWhat Is the Role of Linear Algebra in GPUs? # GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are designed to perform many small math operations in parallel. Most of these operations are linear algebra tasks, like:\nMatrix multiplication\nVector addition\nDot products\nThese operations are used in:\nGraphics (e.g., rotating 3D objects, lighting)\nAI/ML (e.g., neural networks where weights and inputs are matrices/vectors)\nGPUs are perfect for this because:\nThey can do the same math operation on thousands of numbers at once\nLinear algebra is highly parallel, making it a natural fit\nWhat Type of Linear Algebra Is Used in GPUs? # | Concept | Description | | | | | Vectors | Lists of numbers (1D) | | Matrices | Tables of numbers (2D) | | Matrix Multiplication | Core for transforming data and neural net calculations | | Dot Product | Used in graphics and ML to calculate similarity | | Transpose, Inverse | Used in transformations and solving equations |\nReal AI Example # In deep learning:\nInputs (like images or text) are represented as vectors/matrices\nWeights are also stored as matrices\nThe output is computed using matrix multiplications\nThe GPU is the engine that performs these operations quickly.\nWhat Is the Role of Linear Algebra in AI? # Linear algebra is the engine of AI.\nIt helps us represent and transform data — whether it’s images, audio, or text — into a mathematical format that machines can learn from.\nAI works with numbers, and linear algebra gives us a clean way to:\nStore data (as vectors and matrices)\nTransform data (rotate, scale, combine)\nLearn patterns (using matrix multiplications and updates)\nSimple Example # A black and white image is just a grid of numbers (pixel brightness) — this is a matrix.\nTo process the image:\nAI uses matrix operations, like multiplying it with a weight matrix\nThis helps the model detect edges, corners, and patterns\nThe same applies to text and audio — everything is turned into matrices or vectors.\nAlgorithms from Linear Algebra Used in AI # | Algorithm / Concept | Use in AI | Example | | | | | | Matrix Multiplication | Core of neural networks | Input × Weights = Output | | Dot Product | Measures similarity | Word embeddings similarity | | Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors | Dimensionality reduction (PCA) | Compress high-dimensional data | | Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) | Recommendation systems | Netflix/movie suggestions | | LU / QR Decomposition | Solving systems of equations | Optimization problems | | Transpose, Inverse | Reshaping and solving systems | Reversing transformations |\nComparison \u0026amp; Transformation # | Without Linear Algebra | With Linear Algebra | | | | | Raw data handled manually | Data represented as matrices | | Hard to find patterns | Easy to apply transformations | | Slow calculations | Fast parallel operations on GPUs | | Hard to scale to big data | Scales well using matrix operations |\nSummary # Linear Algebra is the core language of AI\nIt lets AI store, transform, and learn from data\nIt is used deeply in both hardware (GPU) and software (code)\nKey operations like dot products, matrix multiplication, decompositions power every AI model\nHardware Perspective (GPU \u0026amp; CPU) # GPUs love matrices: They can process thousands of matrix multiplications at once\nFaster matrix operations mean faster training\nAll deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow and PyTorch) rely on GPU acceleration for this reason\nLinear algebra fits perfectly into hardware like GPUs, which are built for parallel math.\nGPUs contain thousands of small cores that can multiply numbers and add them — ideal for matrix operations in AI.\nSo when your model runs input × weights, the GPU does this fast and in parallel, unlike a CPU that works step by step.\nExamples:\nTraining a neural network with 1 million weights may take hours on a CPU, but minutes on a GPU\nProcessing an image with 1,000,000 pixel values × 10,000 weights is handled much faster on a GPU\nSoftware Perspective (AI Libraries \u0026amp; Code) # AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NumPy are built on top of linear algebra libraries such as:\nBLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)\ncuBLAS (NVIDIA’s GPU-accelerated version)\nBLAS provides a standard interface, which means AI software written for it can run efficiently on many kinds of hardware.\nNVIDIA cuBLAS is a GPU-accelerated library optimized for AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC). It provides drop-in support for industry-standard linear algebra operations.\nWhen you write something like:\noutput = layer(input) That code actually performs matrix multiplication in the background.\nEven if you don’t see the math, it’s all vectors, matrices, and dot products under the hood.\nExample:\nWord2Vec converts words into vectors and finds similarity using the dot product — powered entirely by linear algebra.\nConclusion # Linear Algebra is not optional — it\u0026rsquo;s essential for understanding how machine learning models are built, trained, and deployed.\nFrom the way we store data, to how we train models, and the hardware/software we use — linear algebra is at the center of it all.\nBy learning it, you\u0026rsquo;re not just learning math — you\u0026rsquo;re learning the language of AI.\n**P.S:**if you spot any mistakes, feel free to point them out — we’re all here to learn together! 😊\nHaris\nFAST-NUCES\nBS Computer Science | Class of 2027\n🔗 Portfolio: zenvila.github.io\n🔗 GitHub: github.com/Zenvila\n🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/haris-shahzad-7b8746291**\n🔬 Member: COLAB (Research Lab)**\n","date":"8 September 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/linear-algebra-for-ai/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Linear Algebra For Ai","type":"posts"},{"content":" The Builder\u0026rsquo;s Mindset # I\u0026rsquo;m a Computer Science student who prefers the terminal over a GUI.
