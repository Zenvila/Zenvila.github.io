## The Challenge

Manual infrastructure provisioning and configuration is time-consuming and inconsistent across environments.

Combined Terraform for infrastructure provisioning with Ansible for configuration management, creating a fully automated deployment pipeline.

## Key Achievement

Eliminated manual setup steps, reducing infrastructure deployment time from days to minutes with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.

## Technologies Used

Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
