## The Challenge

Manual penetration testing is slow and repetitive. Security teams need automated tools that can adapt and learn from previous test results.

## The Solution

Developed an AI-driven scanner that generates fuzzing commands dynamically and uses NLP to interpret terminal outputs, running multiple test cases automatically.

## Key Achievement

Automated 80% of routine security testing, discovering vulnerabilities 5x faster than traditional manual methods.

## Technologies Used

Python, AI/ML, NLP, NLU, Nuclei, Penetration Testing Tools
