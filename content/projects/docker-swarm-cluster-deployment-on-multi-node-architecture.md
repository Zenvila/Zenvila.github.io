## The Challenge

Single-server deployments lack scalability and fault tolerance. Production systems need distributed container orchestration.

## The Solution

Built a Docker Swarm cluster across two physical machines running Arch Linux, with manager and worker nodes for container orchestration.

## Key Achievement

Achieved high availability and load distribution, demonstrating enterprise-grade container deployment on bare metal infrastructure.

## Technologies Used

Docker, Docker Compose, Linux, Container Orchestration
