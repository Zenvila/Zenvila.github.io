## The Challenge

Analyzing thousands of drone log entries manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Traditional keyword searches miss contextual relationships between events.

## The Solution

Built a semantic search system that converts log entries into vector embeddings, allowing analysts to query by meaning rather than exact keywords.

## Key Achievement

Reduced log analysis time from hours to seconds, enabling real-time insights into drone behavior patterns and mission-critical events.

## Technologies Used

Python, sentence-transformers, NumPy, Pandas, Tkinter (GUI)
